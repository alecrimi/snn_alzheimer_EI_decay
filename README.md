# Learning Alzheimer's Disease Signatures in EEG  
## Spiking Neural Networks and E/I Imbalance Simulations

This repository accompanies the paper:

**“Learning Alzheimer's Disease Signatures in EEG: Spiking Networks and E/I Imbalance Simulations”**

The project presents a unified neuromorphic and mechanistic framework for studying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from resting-state EEG data by combining:

- Spiking Neural Network (SNN)–based EEG classification  
- Network-based statistics (NBS) on functional connectivity  
- Biophysically grounded spiking network simulations of excitation–inhibition (E/I) imbalance  
- Functional connectivity–informed large-scale simulations  

The goal is to link **data-driven classification** with **mechanistic modeling**, providing interpretable EEG biomarkers grounded in cortical circuit dynamics.
